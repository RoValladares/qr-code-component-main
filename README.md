## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for typography

### What I learned

While working on this project, I refined my skills in:

- Using **flexbox** for centering elements both horizontally and vertically:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
```

- Properly linking external resources like Google Fonts to ensure typography renders correctly:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

- Structuring a simple and accessible HTML layout for better readability and usability.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Explore advanced responsive design techniques to handle a wider range of screen sizes.
- Experiment with CSS animations to enhance user experience.
- Focus on improving accessibility, such as testing with screen readers and adding ARIA labels where necessary.
